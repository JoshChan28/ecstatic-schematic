# All the CS peeps who've I've picked brains with... No brains were harmed in the process

## John Economist turned Data Engineer
### Takeaways
**Database desc**
Started out as a data analyst and was grew an interest in data engineering. Through different positions at Bank of Canada, Shopify, Unata, and Snap Commerce, developed skills as a data analyst for data engineering. Did not do any courses on coding but learned everything he needed to know through data analytics as coding slowly grew as part of the job.

**What is Data Engineering?**
	\- Working with data specific problems not micro services like backend
	\- working with frameworks, pipeline dataflows, getting data from point A to point B
		_This would be interesting for me I think_
	\- Data injection pipelines, bringing data together onto platforms like snowflake or databricks
	\- One might be building platforms for data transfers

**What is Backend?**
	\- Backend is more like a live service, making requests for data

**Data in general**
	There are three types data transfers
		\- live data transfer (Backend)
		\- bach services - taking data chuncks to process
		\- real-time streaming - data being processed as it comes in
\###Tips:
Start with backend/fullstack and get a internship go into data engineering later

## Josh "You too?!?!"
**Who is Josh?**
Not me Josh from the Josh and Josh and Serin Barrie Bitch house. He's a front end dev who won't show his work until later (how mysterious. bet it'll be pretty cool!). A fellow Queen's Engineer  in Software Eng, not Mech and has little use for showing up to class, I'm pretty sure he's been coding since before I knew what a nest for-loop nested in a for-loop was!
**Hobbies**
He can stay up all night playing video games or playing sports with a group of fellas. High key addicted to League and/or Vallo but also loves to go out and play sports. Any kind of sports. He won't cook for me but he'll do my dishes... though he'll sometimes steal my food from the fridge when he's doing the dishes.
**What we talked about**
- The front end is everything that you see, pictures, videos, style of the website or app
- backend is where the pull and get requests are made, things that yo don't see
- Check out the youtube channel FreeCodeCamp.org for more insights
**Good starting projects?**
- Instead of looking for Python projects, look for projects using a framework, like a Django Project
- Use Leetcode
- Don't feel behind, everyone feels behind....

## Maggie "In-Person Coffee Chat... Say What?!"
### Another frontend Dev
**Who is Maggie?**
A friend of a friend... of a friend who has an amazing website and a great Front End Dev! Was the Sony version of Luan doing testing for Play Station but for the store for a few coops. A CS/Business student at UoW who's been to a many hackathons and has used that as a base for starting projects. Apparently if you force yourself to start and finish a project in 3 days, you'll do that!
**Hobbies?**
- Why didn't I ask this? Ohh... I hadn't talked to Nick yet!
**Takeaways**
- Did a bit of QA Automation testings at Playstation. Like a Sony version of what Luan was doing.
- Frontend devs work closely with customers to make things look the way that they want them to
- Start with a website and go from there, great starting position
- Things learned from school is more how to write good code, but the coding aspect, learning languages are more so just learning yourself.
- School is like algorithms and data structures, learn to code yourself
**Choosiing a project**
- Do something you're passionatate about
- Join a Hackathon
- Create something that I can use everyday - Help yourself out

- flex box froggy for CSS
- LeETCOde!!!

## Aaron "Coffee Chat or Party Chat?"
**Who is Aaron?**
Someone who's had lots of experience making small video games (He might play a lot of games) but thinks he might want to go into Fullstack dev. A CS student at UoT that's not really sure where he wants to go. He's used some Django and has taken many OS courses. WebDev because who doesn't go into that right... Josh... Maggie...?
**Hobbies**
- Likes to play video games
- .... That's about all I got before the party vibes reached us....
**Take aways**
- Do a project that interests your
- Do some daily coding problems
- Use LEETCODE for interviews

##Nick "Welcome to the grind!"
**Who is Nick?**
A friend of a friend of a friend... of a friend... who is now my friend :) Very smart guy who's pursuing his start up in the dog patch (How interesting!). A UBC CS student who's devoting lots of his time into his baby of an app. He's a walking knowledge base of data and unfortunately, he was interviewing me and not me to him... But I still got quite a bit from him!

##KJ "Oh, you're a data engineer too?"
