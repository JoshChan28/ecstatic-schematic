# Takeaways and notes from my Coffee Chats with live walking databases

## John Economist turned Data Engineer

### Takeaways

**Database desc**
Started out as a data analyst and was grew an interest in data engineering. Through different positions at Bank of Canada, Shopify, Unata, and Snap Commerce, developed skills as a data analyst for data engineering. Did not do any courses on coding but learned everything he needed to know through data analytics as coding slowly grew as part of the job.

**What is Data Engineering?**
	\- Working with data specific problems not micro services like backend
	\- working with frameworks, pipeline dataflows, getting data from point A to point B
		_This would be interesting for me I think_
	\- Data injection pipelines, bringing data together onto platforms like snowflake or databricks
	\- One might be building platforms for data transfers

**What is Backend?**
	\- Backend is more like a live service, making requests for data

**Data in general**
	There are three types data transfers
		\- live data transfer (Backend)
		\- bach services - taking data chuncks to process
		\- real-time streaming - data being processed as it comes in
\###Tips:
Start with backend/fullstack and get a internship go into data engineering later

### And front and and my Fullstack engineer
- The front end is everything that you see, pictures, videos, style of the website or app
- backend is where the pull and get requests are made, things that yo don't see
- Check out the youtube channel FreeCodeCamp.org for more insights
**Good starting projects?**
- Instead of looking for Python projects, look for projects using a framework, like a Django Project
- Use Leetcode
- Don't feel behind, everyone feels behind....

## Maggie "In-Person Coffee Chat... Say What?!"
### Another frontend Dev
- Did a bit of QA Automation testings at Playstation. Like a Sony version of what Luan was doing. 
- Frontend devs work closely with customers to make things look the way that they want them to
- Start with a website and go from there, great starting position
- Things learned from school is more how to write good code, but the coding aspect, learning languages are more so just learning yourself.
- School is like algorithms and data structures, learn to code yourself
**Choosiing a project**
- Do something you're passionatate about
- Join a Hackathon
- Create something that I can use everyday - Help yourself out
